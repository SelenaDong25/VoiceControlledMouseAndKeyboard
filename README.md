May 2021

Project Description:
* Contemporary new technology empowers every person and every organization to achieve more in everyday life. 
* Voice command-controlled mouse and keyboard make computer accessible for people in special needs. 
* Beyond that, it also free up hands to operate a computer in normal people’s life.
* This project will develop a tool in Python environment, which can recognize human’s voice of simple mouse/keyboard command, then operate the command on computer.

Project Justification:
* Voice command control will benefit person in special needs. It also benefits normal computer users for fewer usage of hands.
* There is speech recognition library can be used for this project.
* Some open-source project also can be used as a reference. 
* For this project, if when a person speak to computer and the computer can perform some simple mouse command such as “left click”, “right click”, and “enter” for the keyboard command, then the project is successful.

Python Library & Tool Used:
* SpeechRecognition 3.8.1
* PyAutoGUI 0.9.52
* PyAudio 0.2.11

Reason to Choose SpeechRecognition Library for This Project:
* Ease of Use
  --Code structure is not complicated.
  --Embedded audio file input.
* Flexible
  --a wrapper for several popular speech APIs such as Google Web Speech API so no need to sign up for a service.
* Free and High Rank on Github
